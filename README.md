This is a bot that helps you track your expenditures.
It's a personal project but I hope it will eventually be hosted on a server and available to everybody.

Installation:
1. Install a version of Python >= 3.7
2. Create a virtual environment using ```python -m venv <environment_name>```.
3. Change to CuentasBot directory and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the libraries
4. Create your own .env file and add there your bot's token
